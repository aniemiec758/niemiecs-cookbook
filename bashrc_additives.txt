Add these lines to your ~/.bashrc (or preferably ~/.bash_aliases) to run these scripts like normal commands
	(this assumes that you put this git directory in your home ~/ folder)
Alternatively, you could export the cookbook folder to your $PATH via `export PATH=$PATH:~/niemiecs-cookbook`
    (placing aliases in your .bashrc allows you to annotate a quick description of each script, however)

-

` # niemiecs-cookbook scripts `
alias scripts="cd ~/niemiecs-cookbook; git pull origin master"
	` # pull changes every time you cd in `
alias commit="~/niemiecs-cookbook/commit.sh"
    ` # pushes to master branch of git repo `
alias clocal="~/niemiecs-cookbook/commit.sh local"
    ` # pushes to local git repo, shortening of "commit local" `
alias fclip="~/niemiecs-cookbook/fclip.sh"
	` # file formatting/removing unnecessary whitespace in misc. filetypes `
alias gitclone="~/niemiecs-cookbook/gitclone.sh"
	` # see the usage statement; helps clone someone's github repo into your own `
alias gitrevertall="~/niemiecs-cookbook/gitrevertall.sh"
	` # lets you revert back to a certain hash in the git log without doing any damage; a read-only safe script to run `
alias killmy="~/niemiecs-cookbook/killmy.sh"
	` # a handy tool to kill a process if you know it by name (COMMAND column of "ps -u $USER") `
alias gls="ls -al | grep"
    ` # easier than typing "ls -al | grep <something> every time"
alias lstat="~/niemiecs-cookbook/lstat.sh"
	` # mimics the lstat command; prints a directory's filenames, dates modified, and sizes `
alias mirror="~/niemiecs-cookbook/mirror.sh"
	` # when you need to look at two portions of the same file at once, but don't want to accidentally save changes in both terminals `
alias search="~/niemiecs-cookbook/search.sh"
	` # I just find this simpler than running the "find" command by itself; searches for a file by name in your file hierarchy `
alias swompt="source ~/niemiecs-cookbook/swompt.sh"
    ` # personal PS1 prompts for bash that I find funny, maybe you'll find them funny too; "swompt" stands for "swap prompt" `
alias syntax="source ~/niemiecs-cookbook/syntax.sh" 
	` # takes you to nano's syntax highlighting files, because I love nano (must use "source" because the script uses "cd") `
